BulkFolderPermissions
=====================

I was tasked to remove a inheritance and remove BUILTIN\Users from a bunch of folders. This was the program I created to handle that. 

How-to
======
- Download the zipped file
- Start the program located [../BulkFolderPermissions/BulkRemoveUserPermissions/bin/Debug/BulkRemoveUserPermissions.exe](https://github.com/robinsone/BulkFolderPermissions/tree/master/BulkRemoveUserPermissions/bin/Debug)
- Make sure the program has administrative rights
- when the program prompts you, type the full path to the folder.
- Profit! 

## More information
Currently this program will remove inheritence and builtin\users on the sub-folders and files.
